# Question
What is the difference between `.then` and `.catch`? What are the similarities?

# Answer

The difference between `.then` and `.catch` is `.then` is triggered when the promise is fulfilled while `.catch` is triggered when the promise isn't fulfilled and returns what was caught. They're similar in how both are async code.
