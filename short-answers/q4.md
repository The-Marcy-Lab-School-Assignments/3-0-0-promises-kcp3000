# Question
with `new Promise((resolve, reject) => {...})`, what do the arguments that you pass into `resolve/reject` do?

# Answer

Resolve is the ticket that will eventually get you the pizza while the reject argument is in a way the ticket but for thr wrong pizza place. So if the promise is met, the resolve portion of the argument gets returned and the rejected portion only triggers if the promise isn't met.
