# Question
Consider the following code:

```js
Promise.resolve('Inside promise').then(console.log);
console.log('Outside promise')
```

Which prints first: `Inside promise` or `Outside promise`. More importantly, can you explain why?

# Answer

The `Inside promise` gets printed first because when the promise is fulfilled the resolve portion is the first to get printed since it's successful. Then the `Outside promise` is printed since it's a async type of code; only triggered after the promise is fulfilled.
